# TurboProxy
TurboProxy is a tiny FOSS application which bypasses the "Need to pack turbo apk." toast which shows up while in Battery settings, when Goolag's proprietary "Devices Health Services" (com.google.android.apps.turbo) app has been uninstalled.

**NOTE**: This app is NOT a reimplementation of Device Health Services. It just bypasses the toast. If you are a developer and want this app to become an actual reimplementation of Device Health Services, please send me a pull request with your changes or fork this repo yourself.
